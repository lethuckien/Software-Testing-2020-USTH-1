 a)

-   Fault in (Vehicle.java, Truck.java, CloneTest.java) is in method Truck.clone(). One of possible modification is:
~~~java
@Override public Object clone() {
      Object result = new Vehicle(this.y);
      return result;
   }
~~~
-   Fault in (BigDecimalTest.java) is the inconsistency between methods compareTo() and equals(). One of possible modification is:
    
-   Override one of them
    
-   Overide methods in HashSet or TreeSet
    
-   Fault in (Point.java, ColorPoint.java, PointTest.java) is the inconsistency between superclass and subclass. One of possible modification is:
    
-   Write the same.
    

b)

-   Test case, which does not execute the fault in (Vehicle.java, Truck.java, CloneTest.java), does not uses Truck.equals()
    
-   No test case that can not execute the fault in (BigDecimalTest.java)
    
-   No test case that can not execute the fault in (Point.java, ColorPoint.java, PointTest.java)
    

c)

-   Test case, which does execute the fault in (Vehicle.java, Truck.java, CloneTest.java) and does not create result in an error state, does not test subclass
    
-   Test case, which does execute the fault in (BigDecimalTest.java) and does not create result in an error state, test with 1.00 and 2.00
    
-   No test case that can execute the fault in (Point.java, ColorPoint.java, PointTest.java) and does not create result in an error state
