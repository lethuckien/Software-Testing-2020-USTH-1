1. Provide reachability conditions, infection conditions, propagation conditions, and test case values to kill mutants 2, 4, 5, and 6 in Figure 9.1.

- ∆2 if (B > A)
	* R: always reached.
	* I: (B < A) != (B > A) ≡ A != B
	* P: The infection will force a different path -> the infection will always propagate.

-  ∆4 Bomb()
	* R: B < A (Reached if the statement is True)
	* I: always infects.
	* P: always propagates.

-  ∆5 minVal = A
	* R: B < A (Reached if the statement is True)
	* I: A != B
	* P: always propagates.

  

-  ∆6 minVal = failOnZero (B)
	* R: B < A (Reached if the statement is True)
	* I: B = 0 (The exception is raised if the expression is zero)
	* P: always propagates.
