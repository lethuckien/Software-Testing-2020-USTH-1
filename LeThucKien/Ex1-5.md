Below are four faulty programs. Each includes test inputs that result in failure. Answer the following questions about each program.
a) Explain what is wrong with the given code. Describe the fault precisely by proposing a modification to the code.

 1. findLast(): The iteration doesn't cover the index 0. 
  - Modification:
~~~java
for (int i=x.length-1; i >= 0; i--);
~~~

2. lastZero(): The iteration runs the wrong direction.
- Modification:
~~~java
for (int i=x.length-1; i >= 0; i--);
~~~

3. countPositive(): The condition includes 0 as positive number when its not
- Modification:
~~~java
if (x[i] > 0)
{
	count++
}
~~~

4. oddOrPositive(): 


b) If possible, give a test case that does not execute the fault. If not, briefly explain why not.
-   Test case for findLast():  
`int[] x = {1,2,3}`   `y = 3`
-   Test case for lastZero():
`int[] x = {0, 1, 1}`
    
-   Test case for countPositive(): 
 `int[] x = {-2, 4, -6}`
    
-   Test case for oddOrPos(): 
 `int[] x = {1, 2, 3}`

(c) If possible, give a test case that executes the fault, but does not result in an error state. If not, briefly explain why not.
-   Test case for findLast():
 `int[] x = {1, 1, 1}`  `y = 1`
 
-   Test case for lastZero(): 
 `int[] x = {0}`
 
-   Test case for countPositive():
`int[] x = {1, 2, 3, 4}`  

-   Test case for oddOrPos():
`int[] x = {1, 2, 3}`


d) If possible give a test case that results in an error, but not a failure. If not, briefly explain why not. Hint: Don’t forget about the program counter.

- Test case for all methods: 
`int[] x = {}`

e) For the given test case, describe the first error state. Be sure to describe the complete state.
