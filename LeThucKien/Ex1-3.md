What do we mean by “level 3 thinking is that the purpose of testing is to reduce risk?” What risk? Can we reduce the risk to zero?

 - The purpose of testing is to reduce risk is spot and fix faults and bugs as soon as possible
 - The risk of product failure or malfunction, which costs money and work time
 - We can reduce the risk to zero but it might take a decent amount of time
